**Roulette simulation App**

Very simple interface to test your strategy.
Focuses on playing colors or even/odd.

You only have simple buttons to bet 20, 40 and 60 for either color. Or you can skip a turn. 

This makes it very easy to focus on your strategy and quickly iterate though the rounds. 

Functionality includes a restart button so you can start over.

Results are displayed in a table so you can easily review what numbers were coming and how you were betting.
